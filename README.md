# AI-Powered Smart Survey System
This project is an **intelligent, adaptive employee survey system** that uses AI to generate dynamic personalized questions in a natural conversations, and transforms responses into **structured, analysis-ready insights** for HR and leadership.

It replaces boring, static surveys with an **interactive, theme-based AI dialogue** that feels like a human interview but behaves like a professional feedback instrument.

### Purpose of the Project

Traditional surveys suffer from:

* repetitive and generic questions ( not role specific or dynamic)

* low engagement

* poor response quality

* rigid structure

* difficult “free-text” analysis

This project solves those problems by combining LLM conversational intelligence with a controlled survey framework designed for organizations.

### The result:
A system that **asks the right questions** based on the **employee's role, business area** and organisation **goals**. It adapts **intelligently**, and produces **structured insights**.

### What the Project Does
1 Generates Intelligent Survey Questions (AI Driven)

The AI creates natural, human-sounding questions across themes such as:

* Leadership

* Company culture

* Workload & priorities

* Team communication

* Clarity & alignment

It ensures:

* at least 5 questions per theme

* no repeated questions

* smooth conversational flow

* relevant follow-ups based on previous answers

This makes the survey feel like a thoughtful interview rather than a form.

2 Adapts Dynamically — But Follows Structured Rules

Even though the AI has freedom to generate text, the system controls the structure:

* theme order

* Controlled transition

* what has already been asked

* History tracking

* when the survey ends

### 3. Saves All Responses Clearly for Analysis

Every generated question and every employee answer is stored cleanly in Supabase.

This enables:

* structured reporting

* sentiment analysis

* theme insights

* organization-level summaries

### 4. Ensures a Stable, Predictable Experience
The system prevents:

* AI “going wild”

* random topic jumps

* repeated questions

* disorganized conversations

It is essentially an **AI interview engine** with **professional survey constraints**.
This blend of **flexibility + governance** is what makes the system **unique**.

### why this project is special:
This project combines the best of both worlds:

| Traditional Survey        | Pure AI Chat             | This Project                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Boring/tedious: requires different forms for different roles to design tailored questions     | Engaging but chaotic      | Structured *and* engaging               |
| Fixed questions           | Random questions          | Theme-based, controlled questions       |
| Repetitive                | Unpredictable             | No repetition                           |
| Rigid                     | Too flexible              | Smart + governed                        |

**Most tools give either rigid forms or uncontrolled AI chat** 

This project provides:

* LLM-generated dynamic questions

* theme-based survey structure

* survey-style answer capturing

* complete progress tracking

* predictable flow + controlled logic

* support for different roles, business areas, and goal types

**All in one unified system.**
